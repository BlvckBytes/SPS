This is the software which'll make oldschool SkyPvP with new and creative features possible again, all while learning to get rid of those repeating tasks that every bukkit-dev is facing all the time. Database I/O, Commands, Events - all of that should be simple and non-repetetive. Simplicity is the solution needed to keep this from being a clusterf*** - just like terry tought us.
